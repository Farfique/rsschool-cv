## Summary

I think I’m the right candidate for you, if you’re looking for someone who:

- is absolutely capable of independent work and doesn’t need constant checking and surveillance;
- does care about her teammates and does her best not to let them down;
- is always eager to learn something new and, besides that, is learning fast;
- loves to immerse herself in the world of logic, dependencies and patterns;
- has seen projects and work processes from almost all perspectives: advertising and SMM, quality assurance, design, development and analytics.

You are my dream employer if you:

- work on an IT project in one of these domains: time-management, project-management, e-learning or e-health. I do consider jobs from other spheres, but this is where my heart is;
- don’t think stress is the best environment for productive teams;
- give your employees the freedom to decide which hours to work.
